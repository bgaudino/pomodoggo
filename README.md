# üê∂ pomoDoggo

[pomoDoggo](https://pomdoro.dog) is a simple [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app that also fetches a picture of a random dog from [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

## Usage

Select the length in minutes of your desired work and break periods. Then just hit start. When the timer reaches 00:00 an alarm will sound (or bark) and the new break/work period will start along with a new dog pic. Get a new dog pic at anytime by pressing 'Fetch'.
